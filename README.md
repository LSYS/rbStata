### Statement of Need

Stata `.dta` data files are not forward compatible. 
For example, you cannot use Stata 13 to read a `.dta` exported from Stata 17.

So what is one to do when colleagues or classmates send you a `.dta` from their newer version of Stata and you end up with the following error because you have no access to newer Stata versions?
