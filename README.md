# wbStata

A quick and dirty CLI (command-line interface) to go way back with Stata data (`.dta`) files.

### Statement of Need

Stata `.dta` data files are not forward compatible. 
This means you cannot use and older version (e.g., Stata 13) to read a `.dta` file exported from newer versions (e.g., Stata 17).

So what is one to do when colleagues or classmates send you a `.dta` from their newer version of Stata and you end up with the following error because you have no access to newer Stata versions?
